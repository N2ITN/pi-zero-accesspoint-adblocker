# pi-zero-dns-filter
This is a local DNS proxy designed for filtering adware and malicious websites from a local network. It is built to run on a raspberry pi zero.

## Easy configuration
The software uses bash scripts, auto-generated html and cron jobs to provide a wireless hotspot utility. Once the device is powered up, the user can connect to the rapsberry pi and is guided through setting their router's preferred DNS to the device's local IP address.
## Secure, fast internet
Once set up, the device uses the popular "pi-hole" ad/malware filtering package inside of a docker container to provide a faster, less intrusive, and more secure internet experience for any devices connected to their home network, whether connected via wifi or ethernet.
